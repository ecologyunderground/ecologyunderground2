## **Itinerary**

### Tuesday, August 4th
Time (EDT): 12:30 to 4:45 pm

Sessions:

INS 20 - Harnessing the Soil Ecological Data Revolution: Challenges, Opportunities, and a United Way Forward (60 min)

OOS 21 - Ecological Responses to Drought Across Scales (60 min)

OOS 7 - Linking Climate, Microbial Adaptation, and Ecosystem Processes (60min)

Description

Day one will focus on key frontiers in understanding the response of belowground systems to climate change. One of the best ways of predicting future ecosystem responses to global change is to understand the mechanisms driving current soil community assembly and functions across disparate environments. In INS20, we will set the stage by gathering ten soil ecologists from disparate disciplines and scientific approaches from ecosystem modelers, to soil biogeochemists, and soil biogeographers to create a unified approach to understanding soil ecosystems at the global scale. With climate change, rainfall patterns are expected to change in the future, with tremendous consequences for humans and ecosystems. In OOS21, we feature work quantifying microbial, plant, and ecosystem response to drought, with particular focus on grasslands and croplands and studies that aim to scale or generalize ecosystem responses to drought. The response of ecosystem processes to climate change will vary depending on both microbial community and evolutionary dynamics, but the interactions between these forces are under-studied. In OOS7 we feature investigations in rapid evolution, community assembly, trait-based models, and eco-evolutionary dynamics to link climate, microbial community, and ecosystem processes. Together, these sessions will provide key insights needed to understand and model how below-ground ecosystems are responding to climate change.

### Wednesday, August 5th

Time (EDT):  9.30 to 11.30 am (morning) and 1.00 to 2.30 pm (afternoon)

Sessions: 

OOS 62 - The Next Belowground Frontiers for Trait-Based Ecology: Moving Beyond Root-Trait Measurements

OOS 73 - Root Dynamics in a Changing World: Deep and Dark Effects on Ecosystem Function 

OOS 53 - Bridging the Gap Between Fine-Root and Fungal Functional Traits

Description: 

We are experiencing a belowground data revolution: Like mushrooms, data on fine-root and fungal traits are sprouting up everywhere. It is time to tackle some of the biggest questions and shape the future directions in belowground ecology. OOS 62 will lead the way by featuring presentations on the most recent accomplishment of root trait studies. In particular, speakers will approach the genetic mechanisms of root trait variation, the role of root traits in ecosystem processes or the interaction between root traits and soil microorganisms. In turn, OOS 73 sheds light on the deep and dark effects of root dynamics on ecosystem functions. Researchers in this session focus on the understudied tropical biome to understand the role of roots in forest resilience, drought resistance or reforestation. Lastly, OOS 53 proposes a path forward: Bridging the gap between fine-root and fungal functional traits. Speakers in this session take up a challenge by linking fine root traits to mycorrhizal fungal traits, to mycorrhizal networks and beyond. Together, we will pave the way for  next generation research on belowground trait-based ecology.
